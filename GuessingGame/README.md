Use diceRoll.js to generate a number
Requires user input 
Compares the user input to randomly generated number - Borrowing logic from our Dice Roll game
    If guess is lower / higher ask user for another input
    Loop until 10 guess OR number has been guessed
If the number was guessed correctly, state the number of guesses
If the number was not guessed correctly, state the number
